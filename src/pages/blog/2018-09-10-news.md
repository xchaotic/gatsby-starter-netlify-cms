We have been running a consultancy, Kode1100 for 10 years. 18 months ago we moved and set up Paxos. Things have been busy and we didn't have a website until now.

The website is a static site, generated with [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org). In the near future, I hope to write some blog posts on why we chose JAM stack and why we it's it's best approach for building fast, modern and secure websites.
